# Basketball Stats Tool 1.0

## About
Given a list of players and a list of team names, this tool adds players to each team until all players have been added. Teams are balanced by their total player count and experience level.

Once the teams are formed, the user is presented with a menu allowing them to view a team's stats or quit the app.

Team stats displayed include: total number of players, total number of experienced players, total number of inexperienced players, average height of the team, player names, and player guardians.
